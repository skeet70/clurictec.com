This is my personal website/portfolio/blog. Currently it's just a static site,
and a way for me to experiment with node, Express, Jade, and Stylus. I'm
hoping to build out a CMS for the blog segment using node, as well as a decent
admin interface and dashboard, which will then be broken out into an
individual application.

I'm also hoping to use this site as a platform to play around with asynchronous
web technologies.

This is also meant to be a development example for potential employers.
